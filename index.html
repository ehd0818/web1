    <h2>World Wide WEB</h2>
    <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
